																																																			“Compare Bash with Java”
	Bash and Java are similar in that they contain the same programming principles. Arithmetic operators are largely the same in how they function. Assignment of variables is very similar.
  Formatting of dates is something I had to get used to but having guides and manuals on hand made it easier. Because the program specifications weren’t that demanding, replicating it on Bash was very doable.
  In general, I tried to keep the Java program simple because I’m still new to the Bash language and figured it would be easier to simplify things in Bash as well.
  I did need to import packages for the Java program but did not need to do anything like that for Bash since working with date and time is already native to the language.
  Overall, I prefer working with Java for the obvious familiarity but for really simple tasks, I definitely see the utility of Bash. I particularly enjoy not having to explicitly declare data types and how quick it is to type “echo” for print statements.
